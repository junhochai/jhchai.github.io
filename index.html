	<h2>Research Interest</h2>
	<p> My research focuses on unraveling the learning mechanisms of early language development in young children. By using multiple methods like eye-tracking, naturalistic recordings, and corpus analysis, I investigate early language learning comprehensively to examine the factors shaping early language acquisition. </p>

	<p> To better track language development, I develop innovative, adaptive assessments using Bayesian IRT models during my PhD. These brief, browswer-based tests provide insights into children's linguistic abilities for targeted interventions. </p>

	<h3><a href="https://osf.io/yp6bq/">Extrapolating Age of Acquisition with Limited Data</a></h3>
	<p>Our goal is to examine the viability of estimating AoA for items that did not reach the threshold with the given data. We do that by extrapolating a probability distribution from a binomial generalized linear model fitted on the given data.</p>

	<h3><a href="https://github.com/junhochai/shortCDI_sims/">Bayesian-based, Item Response Theory approach for assessing the vocabulary of young children</a></h3>
	<p>The model consists of two main components: Bayesian-based parameterization of normative data and the utilization of item response theory. Normative data from language-, gender-, and age-matched children is obtained from Wordbank and test items are fitted with normal distributions. Estimated scores are obtained through an affine transformation, and the 2PL Model is used in the item response theory-based computerized adaptive test to estimate the ability parameter of each child. </p>
